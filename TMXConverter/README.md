TMXConverter
=======

Tools for converting TMX images into PNG, so they can be viewed on most computers.
In practice, this means you can convert the assets from *Persona 4* and (potentially) other videogames from the same developer.

## Improvements with regard to other tools

Unlike other tools, this one **keeps the original palette** and references the alpha by it, not pixel by pixel. This means that:
- The resulting images are much smaller (half size or less) than 32bpp conversions
- They are much closer to the original (if you want to preserve the original palette)
- The transparency is readily available

## Building
If you use Debian/Ubuntu/Mint Linux, type the following commands:

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential libfreeimage-dev libfreeimage3
make
```

If you prefer FreeBSD (10.1), type these instead:

```
pkg install freeimage-3.16.0

export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include:/usr/local/include
export LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib

make
```

I am not experienced in native Windows C development, so it's left as an exercise for the reader. If you manage to build on it, patches are welcome :)

## Usage
This directory contain two tools: **BINtoTmx** and **TMXtoPng**.

- BINToTMX extracts TMX files from BIN packages retaining the original filenames. It is meant to be used with P4's character poses; other packages may not work. For the rest of files, you will have much better luck with an hex editor or a bruteforce binary scanner.

- TMXtoPng converts the aforementioned TMX images to PNG.

They are easy to use, just invoke them from the command line:
```
./BINtoTMX package.bin
./TMXtoPng 1.tmx 2.tmx ...
```
